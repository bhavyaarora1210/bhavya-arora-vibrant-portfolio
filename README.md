# Bhavya Arora – Vibrant Portfolio 🌟

Welcome to my personal **portfolio website**! This project is a reflection of my journey as a developer and designer, showcasing my skills, creativity, and passion for building visually engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. The site is designed with a vibrant aesthetic, responsive layout, smooth animations, and interactive elements, making it accessible across devices. It highlights my technical expertise in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (and additional modern tools like frameworks or libraries if integrated), while also serving as a central hub where anyone can explore my work, download my resume, connect with me through social media, or get in touch directly. The portfolio demonstrates my ability to blend design with functionality, offering sections like an about-me introduction, a skills overview, and a clean, professional contact page. It is hosted online for easy access, but can also be cloned and run locally with simple setup steps. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome, as I believe in continuously learning and improving. Thank you for visiting, and I hope this portfolio gives you a clear glimpse into my professional profile and creative identity!
